            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
                Odds are, if you're reading this page, you don't know me. <small>(Otherwise would you be?)</small>
                I'm a senior at the Colorado School of Mines, getting a bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Geological Engineering. 
                My journey through school has been a unique one. I applied to CSM early, in an effort to appease my mom about having not applied 
                to any colleges, simply because there was no application fee or essay. My granddad was a geologist, and I spent a lot of my 
                childhood studying minerals with him. It only made sense to me that I should be one too. I began my first semester in fall 
                of 2013 as an undergraduate geological engineering student, with all the confidence that comes with being
                admitted to such a great school. We had all sorts of meetings and pep talks about how <em>"time-management is key"</em> and I, like most
                students, ignored them. So I bombed calc 1, having never seen a lick of calculus before. This set me back a full year, which was a hard-learned lesson. 
                I kept at it, though, and even scored an internship at a gold mine my sophomore summer. 
            </p>
            <br><p>
                The internship was an incredible experience, and jumping back into school was a breeze with my new knowledge. And then, in the spring semester of my junior year 
                (2016), I took a class wherein you apply probability and statistics to geological data, and I was exposed to MATLAB. It was incredible to me, that I could 
                type a few words on a keyboard and all the sudden have created something new. And so, I switched majors. I was enrolled in the second summer semester section of 
                programming concepts. I became enraptured by C++ and began making silly programs, just because I could. Everything seemed perfect. 
            </p>

            <br><p>
                Unfortunately, my story decided to take a turn for the worse, shortly thereafter. A few days after census day of fall 2016. I got a major concussion. 
                I was throwing a party <em>(yes, I know what you're thinking)</em> at the townhouse I was living in at the time. As you might imagine of college-aged people, 
                my guests became quite intoxicated. I had a lofted bed at the time, so that I could have more storage underneath. One person was puking on my floor, right 
                next to my bed, so I was attempting to mitigate damage and do my best to help them. I heard a creak and glanced upwards from my spot on the floor to witness 
                my impending doom. A girl had done a swan-dive off of my bed, and proceeded to greet my forehead with her own. 
            </p>

            <br><p>
                When I woke up the following day (after a night of cleaning up and getting people home safely), I didn't know where I was. I recognized my belongings just fine, 
                but the room was strange to me. I had lost several months of memory. I didn't remember changing majors, moving, or getting a sales job. And my head hurt. 
                <strong> A LOT.</strong> Light and sound were painful. So I did the only rational thing I could think of: I went to the health center on campus. The nurse 
                told me to go lie in a pitch black room, where I could stay away from as much light and sound as possible, for a few days. When that didn't improve my situation, she 
                told me to do it for a week, and then two. Finally, my parents and I met with the dean to get me medically withdrawn from the school. 
                My family doctor recommended the same thing, but I stayed with my parents, that time. I always thought it was funny, because my doctor said <q>if you had been 
                drinking too, you'd be just fine.</q>
            </p>

            <br><p>
                Eventually I got my memory back, or at least what I can assume is most of it. I still have some trouble concentrating somedays, and my short-term memory can 
                cause me problems too. That could last for another 8 years, though, so there's nothing to do but keep treking.

        <h3>Geology</h3>

        <p>My geology summer internship was spent working at a pit mine site, for a company called Kinross. The mine is named Round Mountain, as is the nearby 
            housing complex for the mine workers and their families. I analyzed a lot of core for faults and potential gold veins, which was an interesting
            endeavor. 
        </p><br>

        <p>The majority of the geology course are spent outside analyzing formations. We often would drive out to different roadcuts and sites for labs. Sometimes, that would be our weekend, as well.

        <h3>Computer Science</h3>
        
        <p>
            This past summer, I had the pleasure as working as a software engineering intern for a team at the Salesforce office in Louisville. 
            A lot of the work went over my head, since I was lacking in HTML and SQL knowledge, but nobody hesitated to help me learn. 
            My fellow interns and I had a blast, doing all sorts of activities together (baseball game, escape room, fancy dinners). We made a strong team 
            and I'm grateful to have worked with them all. 
        </p><br>

                As someone who has spent a significant amount of time on different games, I've found myself collecting dice. The process in which 
                they are made fascinates me, and I've found myself with an overwhelming number of beautiful colors. I enjoy the probability of them 
                and knowing that they are never completely random, due to defects or weight differences. Consequently, the most common thing for me to include in any 
                program I make for myself is a random number function:
            </p>

        <pre><code class="rand">
            Random rand = new Random(); 
            int value = rand.nextInt(20); 
        </code></pre>
