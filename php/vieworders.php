/* We are going to add one more page to our store.  Create a file named vieworders.php with a corresponding nav bar dropdown option "View Orders".

This page will now read the contents of the orders.csv file.  We want to group orders by customer (assuming all customers with the same first and last name are the same person).  For each customer, show all the orders they have placed (time, item, quantity, total) as well as their grand total.  Finally, display the grand total of all orders placed by all customers.

If there no orders in the orders.csv file, or the file does not exist, display an appropriate error message. */
