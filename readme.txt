HTML5 and CSS3

The CSS3 properties used to create the styled nav bar:

list-style-type:none;       -       Removes bullet points from list
float: left;                -       Makes the navigation bar float left of the page
text-align: center;         -       Aligns the text in each tab in the center
text-decoration: none;      -       Removes underlines from hyperlinks
padding:                    -       Adds space between text and border
border:                     -       Makes a border around the list item
border-radius:              -       Rounds the border
margin:                     -       Adds space between borders of items
overflow: hidden            -       If there is too much text, doesn't display all of it.
:hover                      -       Allows for changing properties when hovering over an item
display: none;              -       Makes the items in the drop-down menu invisible
position: absolute;         -       Makes the nav bar absolute instead of sticky
min-width: 160px;           -       Gives a minimum width to the nav bar in order for it to display
z-index: 1;                 -       Gives an increased z-index so that the nav bar sits on top of the page
pointer-events: none;       -       Makes it so that the currently accessed page cannot be clicked on
cursor: default;            -       Removes special design on the mouse, so that it doesn't appear like it can click on anything.
background-color:           -       Sets the background color for the item
color:                      -       Sets the text color.
font-family:                -       Sets the font family for the text.
font-weight                 -       Sets the weight of the font


I chose to make my original internal-link on the about me page to the bottom of the page (see "toothlessLink") into a button.
This allows for the specified area around the link to also be clickable.
I adjusted its properties to be more visually appealing and used a transition to fade in on hovering.

I also added a 3D transform to my top-most picture of the aboutme page. It allows for my image to be flipped across the 
y axis upon hovering. I added in a transition time, to make it smoother. See ("Rockies").
