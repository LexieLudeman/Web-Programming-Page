/*Similarly, create a file called templateFooter.php that contains all the footer information for your pages.  Include this file at the bottom of every page.  Make sure your validation links represent the current page as well.

If you view your pages at this point, then you should see your jQuery submission reproduced in PHP form.

We're going to make one addition to the footer.  Add a line somewhere that states "This page was last updated MM/dd/YY hh:mm" with the file's last edit time for the Mountain Timezone.*/
